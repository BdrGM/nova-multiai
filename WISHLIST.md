Ideas and possible features for NOVA Multi-AI.  
This list is not a roadmap — just things I’d like to add when time allows.

---

## 🎙️ Voice Integration (Future / No Set Date)
- Connect with **Notesbot** so players can talk to the AI by voice.
- Requires webhook support on the Notesbot side (dev mentioned it may come later).
- Until then this feature is **on hold**.

---

## ⚙️ Macro Hooks (Next Milestone)
- Add **hooks** so Foundry macros can interact with the AI system.
- Goal: let GMs and players extend NOVA with their own macros  
  (e.g. trigger replies, capture responses, custom automation).
- This is the **next planned implementation**.

---

## 📚 Knowledge Expansion (Future / Long-Term)
- Let the AI **search inside Journals** for relevant keywords.
- Use the content of journals to improve context in replies.
- Still exploratory — will need careful limits so it stays fast  
  and doesn’t flood the AI with too much text.

---

## 🧠 Memory (Prototype/Long-Term)
- Remembers **recent conversations** per-AI and per-player.
- Designed to be **opt-in** with hard limits (fast + safe).
- Export/import memory to a Journal (“NOVA Memory”) for review and curation.

---

## 🗣️ Option to have the Ai to answer in a different language than the one spoken to it.(I won't do it as you can set it in personality)
- Allow the Ai to be spoken in, let's say English, and have it answer in Klingon or any chosen language
- Have it optional

---

## 📝 Notes
- These are **wishes**, not guaranteed features.
- Timeframe:  
  - **Macros** → next update focus.  
  - **Voice integration** → depends on Notesbot webhook support (external dependency).  
  - **Knowledge search** → long-term idea, not soon.
  - **Memory** → Long-term, probably after macros
